Less structured than Scrum.

4. Project Planning:
   - Explain the key components of project planning in software project management. What tools and techniques are commonly used to create a project plan?
   - ANSWER:Key components include defining project scope, objectives, tasks, schedule, resources, budget, and risk management. Common tools and techniques are:
             -Gantt Charts: Visual timeline of project tasks.
             -Critical Path Method (CPM): Identifying essential tasks.
             -Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Breaking project into manageable sections.
             -Project Management Software: Tools like Microsoft Project, Trello, and Asana.

5. Risk Management:
   - What is risk management in the context of software projects? Outline the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks.
   - ANSWER:Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential issues that could impact a project. The process includes:
               -Identification: Recognize potential risks through brainstorming, checklists, and expert judgment.
               -Assessment: Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.
               -Mitigation: Develop strategies to reduce or eliminate risks, such as contingency plans, risk transfer, or acceptance.

6. Resource Management:
   - Discuss the importance of resource management in software projects. How do project managers ensure that resources are allocated efficiently?
   - ANSWER:Resource management ensures that the right resources are available at the right time and are used efficiently. Project managers ensure efficient allocation by:
               -Resource Planning: Identifying what resources are needed and when.
               -Scheduling: Allocating resources based on project timelines.
               -Monitoring: Tracking resource usage and making adjustments as needed.
               -Optimization: Balancing workloads and avoiding over/underutilization.
     
7. Quality Management:
   - Explain the role of quality management in software projects. What practices and standards are typically employed to ensure the quality of the software product?
   - ANSWER:Quality management ensures the software meets specified requirements and customer expectations. Practices and standards include:
              -Quality Assurance (QA): Systematic activities to ensure quality.
              -Quality Control (QC): Testing and inspection of deliverables.
              -Standards: Following ISO, CMMI, or industry-specific standards.
              -Practices: Code reviews, automated testing, continuous integration, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

8. Project Monitoring and Control:
   - How do project managers monitor and control the progress of a software project? Describe some key performance indicators (KPIs) and tools used for this purpose.
   - ANSWER:Project managers monitor and control progress through regular status reports, performance reviews, and variance analysis. Key KPIs include:
              -Schedule Variance (SV): Difference between planned and actual progress.
              -Cost Variance (CV): Difference between budgeted and actual costs.
              -Burn-down Charts: Tracking remaining work against time.
              -Tools: Project management software like Jira, Microsoft Project, and Asana.
